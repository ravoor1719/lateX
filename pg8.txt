\section{Introduction} Theorems can be easily defined:
\begin{theorem}
Let \(f\) be a function whose derivative exists in every point,then \(f\) is a continuous function.
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}[Pythagorean theorem]
\label{pythagorean}
This is the theorem about right triangles and can be summarized in the next equation
\[x^2+y^2=z^2\]
\end{theorem}
and a consequence of theorem \ref{pythagorean} is the statement in the next corollary
\begin{corollary}
There's no right rectangle whose sides measure 3cm,4cm, and 6cm.
\end{corollary}
You can reference theorems such as \ref{pythagorean} when a label is assigned.
\begin{lemma}
Given two line segments whose lengths are \(a\) and \(b\) respectively there is a real number \(r\) such that \(b=ra\).
\end{lemma}
