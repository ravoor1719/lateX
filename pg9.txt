\section{Introduction}
LATEX is a document preparation system for the TEX typesetting program. It enables you to produce publication-quality output with great accuracy and consistency. LATEX
works on any computer and produces industry-standard PDF or PS documents.\cite{alanazi2021boosting}
It is available both in free (open-source) and commercial implementations. LATEX can be used for any kind of document, but it is especially suited to those with a complex structure, repetitive formatting, or notations like mathematics1
;\cite{nugroho2019skins}
technical stability, dimensional accuracy, or a persistent and non-proprietary file
format are needed: \cite{thakur2020lung} Install the free software from www.tug.org or buy a commercially-supported version from one of the vendors
Leave a blank line between paragraphs as you
type. To LATEX, this means ‘start a new paragraph’, not ‘leave a blank line’. You can control spacing and indentation by setting \cite{samhitha2020prediction}
and \parindent with the \setlength command as in the previous example, or with the parskip package.
I used LaTeX to layout my report, as it provides beautiful mathematics and a powerful way of handling references. Along the way I learned quite a lot about using it effectively, which might be of help to other people writing a thesis, so hence this page.\cite{rahman2023multiclass}

I found a lot by Googling and reading tutorials,\cite{abcs} and the the compulsory\cite{cmritlibraray} read for anyone starting with LaTeX \cite{sowmya}is The Not So Short\cite{xyz} Introduction to LaTeX\cite{jrfrhijr}
